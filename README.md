## Overview
Our client, W. Avy, is looking to launch his own surf shop. He wanted some additional data on the temperature changes to help with his decision making. He was specifically interested in the the temperature data for the months of June and December in O'ahu. This would help him to decide if the surf and ice cream store business can be sustained year-round. 

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

-The June temperature data is provided above, it can be seen that for majority of the month the temperate is between 73-77 degrees Fahrenheit. 

-The December temperature data is provided above. The temperature of O'ahu in december is mostly between 69 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit. 

-December is cooler than June, and has a wider range of temperatures throughout the month. which can be seen through the difference in the minimum and maximum temperatures and also due to a higher standard deviation. 

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Based on the findings of the analysis, it can be determined that the temperatures between June and December are comparable and is acceptable for surfing. I would dig deeper and get the precipitation data for both months. This will help W. Avy make a better decision on the potential success of a surf shop. I would also try to see if the data varies significantly with different locations.
